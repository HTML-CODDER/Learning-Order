## Pros and Cons
****
I believe these are strengths and weaknesses of each program:

|Codecademy |  Treehouse	|	
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|Pros:														| Pros:																		|
| - instant feedback							| - More thorough coverage of topics			|
| - more practice problems				| - More topics covered										|
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|Cons:														|Cons:																		|
| - Tells how, not always why			| - (mostly) walks you through problems		|
| - no projects (behind paywall)	| - video based, so pace is set for you.  |
