## The Master Track
****

Students wishing to learn web development online have a number of free options to choose from. As Oregonians, we have TeamTreehouse as well. Rather than choosing just one to learn from, I believe that the resources can instead work well together and help to cover each other's weaknesses. In my experience learning web development, I've utilized codecademy.com, teamtreehouse.com, and freecodecamp.com extensively, and I've found the combination of the three to be effective in solidifying the essentials of web development. 


## Pros and Cons
****
I believe these are strengths and weaknesses of each program:

|Codecademy |  Treehouse	|	FreeCodeCamp |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
|Pros:														| Pros:																		|Pros:                               |
| - instant feedback							| - More thorough coverage of topics			| - Lots of practical projects       |
| - more practice problems				| - More topics covered										| - Emphasis on problem solving      |
|Cons:														|Cons:																		|Cons:                               |
| - Tells how, not always why			| - (mostly) walks you through problems		| - under-developed lessons          |
| - no projects (behind paywall)	| - video based, so pace is set for you.  | - potentially steep learning curve |


## The Strategy
****
Using this knowledge, I've found an effective strategy to be to use codecademy as syntax practice, treehouse as foundation building, and freecodecamp as a source of quick review and projects. Below


Notes:
Treehouse time estimates can be very conservative, especially when there is a project involved. 
Freecodecamp estimates on the other hand can be much longer than it actually takes you, especially 
if you learn from other places first like I'm suggesting (though I think their estimates are improving). 
Use of resources other than these 3 is warranted and suggested in the data visualization section.

Notes:
The next stages involve the use of frameworks to enhance your websites. FreeCodeCamp used to use 
angularjs, back when I was learning it, but they have since switched to ReactJS.  However, they do not
have any lessons on ReactJS live as of yet, nor do they have any on sass or d3 which together make the
foundation of the data visualization section. While the only classes that I've found that teach React 
have been on Pluralsight.com, I've found that knowing angularjs has made learning react much simpler.
Of course, your mileage may vary. Feel free to learn one or the other, but know that I don't know 
whether my current resources on React will be sufficient on their own.
